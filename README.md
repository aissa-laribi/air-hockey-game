# Air Hockey Game

Air Hockey Game is a multiplayer game in **early stages**  created using the  <a href="https://kivy.org/#home">**Kivy**</a> cross-platform framework. Inspired by the<a href= "https://kivy.org/doc/stable/tutorials/pong.html">Kivy Pong Tutorial</a> and<a href="https://github.com/ahmedfgad/CoinTex"> CoinTex</a>.This game has been tested on Linux but should work on other platforms

## Why this project?

I am not trying to reinvent the wheel, there are already plendy of amazing air hockey games out there.I just want to build full-fledged apps including a GUI and backend with Python.As result, the Kivy framework is the best module that can suit my needs because it is cross-platform and many parts are bind with C which accelerates graphic rendering. Furthermore, this project gives me an opportunity to get hands-on with AI and subfields of machine learning by training the AI to play.
